The morning sun filtered through the curtains, casting the rays into the cozy living room of Mary and John’s suburban home. On the surface, they seemed like an ordinary couple. But cracks had begun to show in their long-lasting relationship, with frequent arguments they could never resolve.
John’s work kept him busy, leaving Mary alone for long stretches of the day. Their neighbour Cleavant often filled that void. Polite and soft-spoken, he’d moved in a few months ago and quickly became a fixture in their lives - always helpful, always present, perhaps a little too present at times.
One fine morning, Mary decided to clear her head with a jog. Her usual trail through the park was quiet, perfect for thinking. But that day, something stopped her - a piece of paper, pinned to a bush by a rock. It caught her eye and she hesitantly picked it up.
It read: **“I am coming for you.”**
The wording struck her as odd. Her heart raced as she looked around. The park was empty, but the unease stayed with her.
Back home, she showed the note to John. He was dismissive, brushing it off as a prank by some bored teenager. But his tone was short, and he seemed distracted. Their conversation quickly spiraled into yet another argument.
As Mary sorted laundry later that day, something caught her eye - a damp, sweaty shirt of John’s. Her suspicion tightened because John never went for jogs, and he hadn’t mentioned going out.
The next day, she returned to the park, hoping to prove to herself that it was nothing. But halfway through her jog, she found another note, pinned in the same way.
This time it read: **“I am guilty, and I cannot take it anymore”**
The words sent her mind reeling. A memory from college, one she had buried deep, surfaced like a ghost. ' **Rutherford' -** the man she and John accidentally killed in their reckless youth and got away with their family's influence. They had sworn never to speak of it again.
This couldn’t be a coincidence. Someone knew.
Mary spun around, her breaths quickening with each passing second. In the distance, she saw a figure and it was John, lurking behind a tree.
Her fear turned to anger as she marched toward him. “What is this? Are you trying to mess with me? Is this your idea of a joke?” Mary questioned with a raising voice.
But before he could answer, another figure emerged from the shadows. In a flash, a knife pierced John’s stomach. Mary froze in horror.
“John!” she screamed, catching him as he collapsed. Blood pooled around them as John whispered his final words: **_Cleavant_** ** _... Save... Murder..._**

###  **The Arrest and the Trial**
The sirens came quickly, and so did the questions. Mary barely processed the police’s accusations as they arrested her. She was the one holding John’s body, her hands stained with blood. To them, it was obvious - she was guilty of second-degree murder.
Mary sat in the interrogation room, her mind spinning. She thought of Rutherford and the notes. But could she confess the truth? If she did, it might only tighten the noose around her neck, as she could then be accused of two murders.
Cleavant appeared at the police station that evening, offering to represent her. “I’ll defend you, Mary. I know you didn’t do this, and I believe in you,” he said, his voice calm, almost soothing. Mary reminded herself of John’s last words and thought, _Maybe John wanted me to choose_ Cleavant _as my lawyer. Only he can save me because he’s an excellent lawyer._ With this in mind, she agreed to face the jury with Cleavant by her side.

###  **The Courtroom Twist**
The trial began with Mary’s life hanging in the balance. Cleavant was relentless, painting her as a loving wife framed for a crime she didn’t commit. He argued that someone else had a motive, though he stopped short of naming names.
Then came the bombshell which no one expected. The opposing counsel revealed a video as evidence. It was unclear but recognizable. It showed Cleavant stabbing John in the park. The courtroom erupted in gasps.
Mary’s heart pounded as she turned to Cleavant. His face remained unreadable.
Later, in the privacy of the holding room, Mary demanded answers. “Why? Why would you kill John?”
Cleavant responded saying, “Some truths are too dangerous to stay buried, Mary. John knew that.”
Before she could press him further, guards escorted him away.

### The Puzzle Deepens
As Mary sat alone, her thoughts churned. The notes. Rutherford. Cleavant. And now this video.
Why had John written those notes instead of discussing them with her directly? Who had sent the video to the opposing counsel? Cleavant's actions were horrifying, but they didn’t add up. What was his connection to John? And why was he so intent on protecting her now? And what would happen if the truth about Rutherford comes out?
Mary stared at the blank wall in front of her, the questions swirling with no answers in sight.
 **Someone knew everything and they weren't finished yet.**
