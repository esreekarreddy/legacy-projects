On parallels with the previous post {[See You 2024](https://esreekarreddy.blogspot.com/2024/12/see-you-2024.html)}
  

Dear 2025,
We barely know each other, but I already feel the excitement and anticipation brewing for what you’re about to bring. You’re like a blind date I’ve been waiting for - probably a complete mystery, full of surprises, a touch of nervous excitement, and the hope that you won’t ghost me halfway through the year. I’m suiting up for what I wish to be a fantastic journey, packed with countless challenges and untold stories.
Right now, I can only imagine the twists and turns you’ll throw at me, much like your older siblings - 2024, 2023, and the rest. But one thing I know for certain is that you're going to offer me the same gift as them.
 **365** days i.e. **8760** hours i.e. **525,600** minutes i.e. **31,536,000** seconds.
Most of this time will be spent on life’s essentials - working, eating, sleeping, and more. A report from Our World in Data reminded me that an average human devotes 80–90% of their day to these basics. That leaves me with only about **54,750** productive minutes in a year to make something truly remarkable out of life.
So here’s what I hope for us - you and me, and how I plan to use the time you give.
####   

#### Work and Career
If you (2025) are going to be a **_Project_** , I am sure mine will be under construction and I hope you provide me the chance to build it.
From what your elder ones taught me, I’ve learned to celebrate small wins and find joy in the process rather than obsessing over the end result. I want to make you a year of _Intentional Growth_ , where every task I undertake aligns with a larger purpose.
I’m gearing up for one of the biggest shifts in my career at the start of the year. It’s daunting yet thrilling, and I’m ready to embrace the challenges ahead with open arms.
* * *
#### Stress and Mental health 
If you are going to be a **_Storm_** , I hope to navigate your waters with resilience and grace.
This year, I aim to give my thoughts less power over me. Better sleep, rest, meditation, and channeling my energy toward peace of mind will be my goals. And if you test me with turbulence, I’ll do my best to steer through it and not sink, finding calm even in chaos.
* * *
#### Relationships and Connections 
If you are going to be a **_Book_** , I want mine to be filled with thoughtful edits and rewrites.
I’ll focus on mending any broken relationships and nurturing the ones that matter. This year, I aim to express my emotions more openly, ensuring the people I care about know their value in my life.
Here’s to strengthening bonds, building new connections, and cherishing the meaningful ones that shape who I am.
* * *
#### Physical Health
If you are going to be a **_Journey_** , I wish mine will be a mix of slow walks and uphill sprints, striving for balance and strength.
In 2024, I took steps toward healthier habits - cutting down on processed foods and sugar. With you, I’ll focus on consistency in workouts and pushing my limits.
I know there will be tempting distractions along the way. Your sibling (2024) won over me a few times but this time, I plan to emerge victorious. 
Cheat days? Of course! I’m ready to balance discipline with enjoyment.
* * *
#### Personal Growth and Learning
If you are going to be a **_Tree_** , I want mine to grow deeper roots and stronger branches.
This year, I aim to plant seeds of change within myself and nurture them into growth, watching them bloom. I want to expand my horizons - whether through books, experiences, or new perspectives and become the best version of myself. I want you to be my compass - a guiding symbol showing clear direction throughout the journey.
My target is simple: to compete only with who I was yesterday, making progress one step at a time.
* * *
#### Fun and Adventures
If you are going to be a **_Festival_** , I hope mine becomes an endless celebration of life’s joys.
I made a sworn promise to myself that I will travel more than I did in previous years. I will take breaks and relax.
I want you to act as an unknown map filled with colorful, unexpected detours. I hope to expect the unexpected and embrace it wholeheartedly.
While I might be aging, my sense of humor remains intact, and I wish to spread happiness to those around me.
* * *
#### Creativity and Hobbies
If you are going to be a **_Painting_** , mine should be unfinished but full of potential.
To be frank, I did not come up with any thoughts of trying new things, and this is on me. But I’m determined to change that. This year, I’ll pour my heart into what I’ve already started - blogging, journaling, and creating.
I hope you paint my journey with vibrant colors of exploration. I’m ready to discover them.
* * *
#### Dreams/Goals
If you are going to be a **_Telescope_** , I want you to represent clarity and focus on long-term aspirations.
This year, I’ll set realistic goals and pursue them with unwavering determination. Procrastination? Not this time.
Though my dreams may seem far away, I’m confident you, as a telescope, will illuminate them for me, and I’ll be ready to catch those rays.
* * *
#### Gratitude for Life 
If you are going to be a **_Seed_** , I’ll ensure you are sown with care and nurtured to grow into something beautiful.
I’ll live in the moment, cherishing the little things and letting go of unnecessary worries.
No grudges, no regrets - only gratitude for every breath I take.
* * *
#### Overall 2025
If you are going to be an **_Epic Poem_** , I hope mine narrates a tale of strength, hope, and renewal - one verse at a time.
I don’t expect you to be perfect, but I do hope for a year filled with balance, meaning, and unforgettable moments.
* * *
To all those reading this: I encourage you to do something similar. Set your intentions, embrace your goals, and prepare to make the most of what’s to come. Reflect on your aspirations and revisit them at the end of 2025 to see how far you’ve come.
Stand tall, 
Wishing you a warm and welcoming 2025!
And this time "Have a Five-Star and Do Something."
