Life is an intricate puzzle, isn’t it? Every day, we navigate through countless emotions, experiences, and decisions. But when you pause and reflect, four words often seem to shape the essence of it all. These aren’t just random words - I believe they are the invisible threads that weave our lives together. Alone, each carries its own significance:
  *  **Change** represents the inevitable flow of our life, the transformations we embrace (or resist) as we move forward.
  *  **Matter** reflects what holds value to us, what makes us pause and say, _"This is worth my time, my energy, my love."_
  *  **People** are the connections that ground us, challenge us, or uplift us through this mysterious journey we call LIFE.
  *  **Priorities** guide our choices, silently shaping the course of our lives.


But here’s the beauty of these words, they don’t exist in isolation. When you combine them, their meaning shifts, creating entirely new phenomena and emotions:
  *  **People Change** : A bittersweet truth we all must learn as we age. 
  * **Priorities Matter** : A reminder to focus on what truly deserves our attention.
  *  **People Matter** : A heartfelt realisation that connections are at the core of our existence on this planet.
  *  **Priorities Change** : An assurance that it’s okay to evolve and let go of the ones that aren't fruitful anymore.


For me each combination unlocks a different perspective on life, and together, they tell a story - a story of growth, of letting go, of finding meaning. Through this post, I want to explore these four layers, not just as abstract ideas but as lived experiences.
Because I feel when one understands how these elements interact, they don’t just navigate life better, they learn to embrace its fluidity. So, let’s unravel this and see how they shape the emotions, challenges, and triumphs of our journey.

### Layer 1: People Change
It’s one of the hardest truths to accept: people change. Yes, they do. The friends you laughed with in school might become strangers or might already have. The person you thought you’d grow old with might have taken a different path. And even the version of yourself you knew so well may no longer exist. Time flies and takes people with it on its path, ever evolving, ever changing.
 **Why does it hurt?**  
Change in people often feels personal. We question ourselves: _Was I not good enough? Was it something I did?_ But in reality, people change for countless reasons - growth, circumstances, and experiences, none of which we can always control. When someone stops talking to you, give it a try, make some effort to regroup what you had, and even then if the other person does not respond, just leave them be. 
**My experience with it:**  
I’ve seen relationships evolve over time, some for the better and some that ended abruptly. There was a phase in my life where I held on tightly to a friend who had changed so much that they were unrecognizable. I struggled to let go, thinking I could bring back the person I once knew. But eventually, I realised that their change wasn’t a reflection of me; it was their journey, and I had nothing to do with it.
 **Lesson:**  
Instead of resisting this change, I’ve learned to accept it, to accept people the way they are. People are like chapters in a book - some stay till the end, while others leave midway. And that’s okay. We can now fill the rest of the book the way we want to. Every person teaches us something, even if their role in our story is temporary.

### Layer 2: Priorities Matter
In a world full of distractions, knowing what truly matters is like finding a compass in a storm, even if you have no clue how to navigate LIFE. For me, priorities aren’t just about time management - they’re about value management.
 **Why do they matter?**  
Your priorities define who you are and what you stand for. What you choose to give your energy to reflects your values, your dreams, and even your self-worth. When we fail to prioritise wisely, life can feel chaotic and directionless.
 **My experience with misplaced priorities:**  
There was a time I let work consume me completely. I thought that sacrificing time with family and friends was the price of success. But as the weeks turned into months, I realised I was missing out on moments that mattered - birthday calls, evening walks, unplanned laughter. It took time, but I shifted my focus to balance. 
**Lesson:**  
Make a list of what truly matters to you and align your actions accordingly, even if it doesn't make sense at the beginning. Life feels lighter when your actions reflect your values.

### Layer 3: People Matter
No matter how independent we claim to be, humans are wired for connection. At the end of the day, it’s the people around us who add warmth and meaning to our lives.
 **Why do they matter?**  
Because love, friendship, and support are what make the hard days bearable and the good days unforgettable. I guess people are the mirrors through which we see ourselves, learn, and grow.
 **My realisation about this:**  
There were phases where I took people for granted, assuming they’d always be there. But life doesn’t work that way. Losing someone - whether through time, distance, or circumstances taught me that relationships need effort. A small “how are you?” or “I’m here for you” can strengthen bonds in ways you can’t imagine. And yes, I am going to send something to someone who I don't want to lose out on.
 **Lesson:**  
Cherish the people who matter to you. Call your loved ones, laugh with your friends, and let your actions show your gratitude. Let me tell you something: People you know, the close ones, they’re not just part of your life - they are your life.

### Layer 4: Priorities Change 
And here’s the twist: as we grow, our priorities evolve. What mattered yesterday might not matter today, and that’s not just normal - it’s necessary.
 **Why do they change?**  
Because growth demands it, and it is absolutely fine if you are facing something similar right now. Life isn’t static, and neither are we. Our goals, responsibilities, and even dreams transform as we move through different phases of life.
 **My journey of shifting priorities:**  
There was a time when I wanted to be something and I planned out to have a career out of it. Every decision revolved around it. But as I grew older, I realised I wanted more - a balance, a deeper connection with myself and others. And then I found something I really like, and all the plans that I made seemed meaningless. Letting go of my old priorities felt like betrayal at first, but it was growth in disguise.
 **Lesson:**  
Give yourself permission to evolve. Holding onto outdated priorities only weighs you down. Embrace the fluidity of life and let your priorities reflect who you are today, not who you were yesterday.

### The Conclusion - Embrace the flow of change 
People will come and go, but the lessons they leave behind shape who we are. Priorities will shift, but they remind us of what truly matters at every stage of life. At the heart of it all are the connections we make, the values we uphold, and the resilience we build as we navigate the ever-changing currents of life.
So, the next time you find yourself resisting change or holding on too tightly, remember: life isn’t meant to be a static drama. It’s a journey of adapting, growing, and becoming. And while the path may not always be clear, the beauty lies in walking it, one step at a time.
Let this be a gentle reminder to appreciate LIFE as what it is and to flow with your own story. Celebrate the people, embrace the priorities, and most importantly, give yourself the grace to grow.
Here’s to embracing life in all its complexities.
