### Do Women Really Need All These Perks?
Let’s be honest - sometimes it feels like women have it easier, doesn’t it?
They get maternity leave, reserved seats, diversity quotas, and women-only spaces. Everywhere you look, there are policies, initiatives, and campaigns dedicated to supporting women. Meanwhile, men? Nobody hands them anything.
If a man struggles, he's told to “man up.” If he fails, he's judged - harshly. But if a woman struggles? People rush to soften the blow - “Oh, she must be going through a tough time. Oh, poor thing, she must be struggling.”
Think about it
▸ Now, men have to compete in the workplace with a system that favors women in the name of "diversity."
▸ Now, men are expected to be "equal partners" at home, sharing chores and childcare, when for centuries, men were the breadwinners.
▸ Now, men can’t even joke or speak freely without being labeled “problematic” or “misogynistic.
And let’s be real - hasn’t society done enough for women already?
  * They wanted to work? We let them into offices.
  * They wanted rights? They got them - education, voting, property.
  * They wanted to break stereotypes? They’re astronauts, soldiers, CEOs, and world leaders.


At this point, what more do they want?
And then there’s the workplace advantage that women seem to have.
  * Workplaces are pushing for gender diversity, giving women extra opportunities - why can’t men just get hired based on merit alone?
  * Women get praised for juggling work and home life, while men are expected to do both without applause.
  * If a woman succeeds, she’s “breaking barriers.” If a man succeeds, it’s just another Tuesday.


And while we’re at it - let’s talk about how society has made it impossible for men to just be themselves.
  * Women can have high standards in relationships - “I need a man who’s ambitious, makes six figures, is tall, fit, and well-dressed.” But the moment a man expresses a preference - “I prefer someone feminine and kind” - he’s labeled as shallow or sexist.
  * A woman can openly say “men are trash” and get away with it. But if a man says something remotely negative about women? He’s instantly canceled.
  * Even the simplest gestures have become complicated - should you hold the door open, or will she get offended? Should you offer to pay, or will she call you old-fashioned?


And here’s something else no one wants to admit - **maybe we made a mistake by letting women into the market.**
The moment women started entering the workforce, men lost their traditional roles. Competition skyrocketed. Households changed. Now, men are expected to provide, be present fathers, and compete with women in the workplace - all at the same time.
And what has this led to?
  * Divorces are at an all-time high. Women are walking away from marriages, and in many cases, they take half the assets, leaving men financially crippled.
  * Alimony and child support laws favor women, making it easier for them to leave while men struggle to rebuild their lives.
  * The dating game is rigged - men are expected to pursue, pay, and impress, but women get to be the ones who “choose.”
  * Women don’t even need men the way they used to. Financial independence has made them more selective, more demanding, and in many cases, less willing to compromise.


And after all the rights, all the opportunities, and all the so-called progress… men are still the bad guys?
It almost makes you wonder - **did we screw up by giving them too much?** Maybe we handed over too much power… and now, we’re the ones paying the price.
* * *
If you resonated with this post so far, if you found yourself nodding along - let me stop you right here.
Sorry to say this, 
You don’t belong here.  
Not on this post. Not on this planet.  
Not in a world that is trying to move forward.  

### The Truth You’ve Been Ignoring
Yes, women get maternity leave - because they bring life into this world, often at the cost of their own health, careers, and sanity.
Yes, they get reservations - but only because for centuries, they weren’t even allowed in those spaces to begin with.
Yes, society is softer on them sometimes - but only because it’s brutal to them in ways many men will never experience.
  * Ever been told to “carry your keys between your fingers” when walking alone at night?
  * Ever worried about being blamed for your own assault based on what you were wearing?
  * Ever been passed over for a promotion because you “might get married and leave”?
  * Ever been told that your biological clock is ticking, as if your worth is tied to how soon you have kids?


Probably not. But ask any woman, and she’ll tell you she has.
Women need everything they’re fighting for and more.
Because for every privilege you think they get, there’s a struggle you will never experience.
  * That reserved bus seat? That’s for the woman who feels unsafe every single day just commuting home.
  * That diversity hiring quota? That’s because generations of bias kept women out of industries they were more than qualified for.
  * That Women’s Day? It’s not just a celebration, it’s a reminder that equal rights didn’t exist for thousands of years, and in many places, they still don’t.


Here’s the Reality: The Playing Field Was Never Equal
  *  **The pay gap?** Real. (Women still earn less for the same jobs, in every industry, worldwide.)
  *  **The fear of walking alone at night?** Real. (Women are taught from a young age to fear for their safety - men are not.)
  *  **The judgment for choosing career over family?** Real. (A woman is ‘selfish’ if she prioritizes ambition, but a man is ‘focused’ if he does the same.)
  *  **The unpaid labor at home?** Real. (Most working women come home to a second shift - cooking, cleaning, childcare, while men ‘help out.’)
  *  **Sexual harassment in the workplace?** Real. (From unwanted comments to career-ending abuse, women navigate obstacles men never face.)
  *  **Lack of maternity support?** Real. (Even in 2024, millions of workplaces penalize pregnancy like it’s a weakness.)
  *  **Domestic violence?** Real. (Statistically, 1 in 3 women will experience it in their lifetime.)


Men and women are not on the same playing field.
Men have had a head start in history, in careers, in opportunities.
Women have had to claw their way up, fighting battles that men never even noticed.
So, the next time you think, _**"Why do women need all this?"**_
Try asking instead: _**“Why did we never give it to them in the first place?”**_

### To the Women Who Made Me Who I Am
To my **mother** \- who taught me that strength isn’t loud or aggressive, but the quiet resilience of holding a family together through every storm.
To my **sisters** and **friends** \- who proved that ambition isn’t a man’s trait, that dreams don’t come with gender labels, and that kindness, even in a world that undervalues it, remains an undeniable force.
To the **teachers** who shaped me - the women who stood at the front of classrooms and made me believe that knowledge is power, and that power belongs to everyone.
To the **women I’ve never met** \- the pioneers, the rebels, the ones who fought battles so the next generation wouldn’t have to. The ones who walked into rooms they weren’t welcome in, so others wouldn’t have to knock.
But gratitude isn’t enough.
Women don’t need more "thank yous." They need support. Respect. Opportunities. Equal footing.
So, here’s what we can actually do:
  * Acknowledge the struggles that still exist, instead of pretending they don’t.
  * Speak up when a woman is dismissed, interrupted, or underestimated.
  * Respect the choices women make - whether it’s career, family, both, or neither.


And if this post made you uncomfortable, good. That means there's something to unlearn.
