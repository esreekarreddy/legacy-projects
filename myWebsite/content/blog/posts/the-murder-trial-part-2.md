Continuing from where we left with [Part 1](https://esreekarreddy.blogspot.com/2024/11/the-murder-trail-part-1.html),
Sitting in her cell, Mary replayed John’s final words in her mind: _**Clevant... Save... Murder**. _A rattling thought struck her, John wasn’t urging her to trust Clevant. He was warning her to save herself from him. John had known too much about Clevant's involvement, and now it was clear that his cryptic notes were a desperate attempt to warn her before it was too late.
Fueled by this revelation, Mary resolved to uncover the truth, even if it meant revisiting the haunting past she had buried for years.

#### The Anonymous Package
The night before her next court appearance, Mary received an anonymous package slipped under her cell door. Inside was an old photograph she wasn’t prepared to face.
It was from the night Rutherford died. She saw herself and John, standing with Rutherford, drinks in hand. But her eyes locked onto a fourth person in the frame, someone she hadn’t noticed before.
It was Clevant, and the sight left her awestruck.
The revelation sent shivers down her spine. Why had Clevant never mentioned that he was there that night?
The package came with no note. Someone wanted her to know the truth, but not all of it.

#### Clevant's Confession
During their next private meeting, Mary confronted Clevant “You knew Rutherford. You were there that night. Why didn’t you ever tell me?”
“Because you didn’t need to know until now, Rutherford was my brother,” he said, emotion filled in his voice. “When he died, my family was devastated. You and John walked away clean, hiding behind money and influence. I lost my only sibling,” he added.
Mary’s heart sank. The guilt she’d buried for years now felt unbearable. “Why didn’t you come after us sooner?” she asked.
“I wanted to see you suffer,” Clevant admitted. “I moved next door to watch the cracks in your perfect life. But then I realized something - I didn’t hate you, Mary. I wanted to protect you. John was the real culprit that night. He pressured Rutherford into that overdose.” 
Mary shook her head. “That’s not true. We were all there. We were all guilty.”
Clevant leaned closer, his eyes cold. “John deserved to die. But you, there’s still hope for you. Help me pin the blame entirely on him. Say he coerced you, manipulated you. If you cooperate, I’ll make sure you walk free.”
Mary recoiled. Could she betray John’s memory, even after everything? But what choice did she have?

#### Why Clevant wants to save Mary
In fact, Clevant fell in love with Mary, and that was the real reason he wanted to save her. His plan all along was to eliminate John and be with Mary. He blackmailed John to come clean, but John avoided discussing these matters at home, afraid Clevant would overhear. Desperate, John went to extremes and wrote the notes to warn Mary.
When things spiraled out of control, Clevant decided to kill John, frame Mary for the murder, and then save her so he could win her trust. But he hadn’t anticipated getting caught in the crosshairs of his own plan.
Mary now started to understand Clevant's true intentions, but she was left in a dilemma: Should she listen to Clevant or come up with her own strategy to save herself?
* * *
#### The Leaked Evidence
As Mary wrestled with Clevant's offer, another twist unfolded. The shadowy figure who had leaked the video now sent another piece of evidence to the prosecution: an audio recording from the night Rutherford died.
The tape revealed a drunken conversation between John and Mary.
John’s voice was clear: “It was an accident, but we can’t let this ruin us. No one will ever know. Agreed?”
Mary’s hesitant reply followed: “Agreed.”
The prosecution wasted no time presenting the recording in court. It painted both Mary and John as co-conspirators in Rutherford’s death.
As Clevant's plan unraveled, Mary came to a chilling realization. Whoever was leaking this evidence wasn’t doing it just to convict Clevant - they wanted to implicate her as well.

####  **But w** ho is that Shadow?
Mary pieced the clues together. The photo. The recording. The video. They were all connected to one person, Rutherford’s estranged fiance, Elena.
Elena had disappeared after Rutherford’s death, but she hadn’t stopped searching for justice. She’d hired a private investigator couple of years ago, someone who had followed Mary, John, and Clevant ever since.
During a tense courtroom confrontation, Elena made her presence known. “You all took him from me,” she said, her voice trembling with emotion. “John. Mary. Clevant. You all played a part. And now the truth will finally come out.” As Elena spoke, Mary’s heart pounded. She wasn’t just exposing Clevant, she was ripping open old wounds Mary had tried to bury for years.
She revealed the final twist: Clevant's motive wasn’t just revenge and that it was guilt. He had supplied the drugs in the party that killed Rutherford. His vendetta against Mary and John was his twisted way of absolving himself.

####  **The Price of Freedom**
As the truth unraveled, the courtroom became a battlefield of accusations. The jury now faced an impossible decision. Mary’s defense argued that she was a victim of circumstance, manipulated by both John and Clevant. The prosecution, armed with Elena’s evidence, pushed for full accountability.
In the end, the jury’s verdict was bittersweet.
Clevant was convicted of John’s murder and sentenced to life in prison. Mary was found guilty of manslaughter for her role in Rutherford’s death but was granted a reduced sentence due to her cooperation and Clevant's manipulations.

####  **The End Game**
Years later, after serving her time, Mary returned to her old neighborhood. The house next door was empty, Clevant's presence a haunting memory. But as she unpacked, she found a letter slipped under her door.
It read: **“** **Freedom comes at a price. We all pay it eventually. But some of us choose how.** **”**
Mary froze. The handwriting was familiar - Clevant's.
Had someone else sent it, or had he orchestrated one final game from behind bars? The answer remained a mystery, but one thing was certain - her past would never truly let her go.
