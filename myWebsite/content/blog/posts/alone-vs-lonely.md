Being alone can be liberating, but feeling lonely can be exhausting.
From my 25 years of life, what I’ve understood is that a person who is alone may or may not feel lonely. Solitude can be a time for self-reflection, peace, and personal growth. On the other hand, loneliness often strikes when one is surrounded by people but still feels disconnected. If you ever get such a feeling, trust me - it’s a signal to pause and introspect.
#### My Journey with Being Alone
Growing up as a single child, I spent much of my childhood alone. At home, I didn’t have siblings to share my time with, and we had few relatives in my city. Initially, it didn’t bother me; I was content in my own little world. But as I grew older, I began to notice a void - a longing for connection that crept in and brought moments of distress.
Being alone wasn’t always a negative experience; I often enjoyed solitude in many ways. I relished meals alone at restaurants, went on solo movie dates, took trips, and even hiked by myself. These moments of solitude allowed me to explore who I was, free from distractions.
One of the funniest memories of my solo adventures was when I decided to treat myself to a fancy dinner alone. The waiter kept glancing at the empty chair opposite me and finally asked, “Waiting for someone?” I confidently replied, “No, it’s just me and the dessert menu tonight!” That moment not only amused me but reminded me how empowering it feels to be comfortable with your own company.

#### Loneliness in a Crowd
However, loneliness was a different beast. During my teenage years and early adulthood, I often felt lonelier than ever. I longed for someone to share my emotions, my highs, and my lows. At times, I completely shut myself off, resorting to isolation, or sought distractions - some healthy, some harmful.
I tried everything to overcome the feeling of loneliness: getting tattoos to feel a sense of connection to something, isolating myself further from bad groups of people thinking it would bring clarity, and even indulging in unhealthy habits like going on hunger strikes and intoxication. None of it worked; in fact, it made things worse. I learned the hard way that addressing loneliness isn’t about escaping it but facing it with courage and intention.
There were also times when I surrounded myself with friends, trying to fill the void. But I discovered that being with people who didn’t radiate positivity only amplified my loneliness. I realized that loneliness isn’t always about the absence of people - it’s about the absence of connection.

#### Lessons from Mythology
If we look at Indian epics, they teach us profound lessons about solitude and loneliness:
  *  **Bhishma** : The great warrior lived a life of solitude by choice. Despite giving up personal pleasures, Bhishma had a purpose that gave his life meaning. His solitude wasn’t a burden; it was his strength. He’s my idol, an ideal person.


  *  **Karna** : In contrast, Karna was always surrounded by people, especially the Kauravas. Yet, he often felt lonely, burdened by sorrow and the weight of his circumstances. Even in a crowd, his heart ached for acceptance and understanding. This taught me that being in good company is more important than being in a larger group.


These characters remind me that being alone can be empowering if you have purpose, but feeling lonely can be a prison if you lack connection.

#### Beating Loneliness with Vibrancy
 ** _Reconnect with Loved Ones_** : Reach out to your best buddies. Simply spend time with them. Laughter and shared moments heal more than we realize.
 ** _Embrace Solitude_** : Learn to enjoy your own company. Do things that bring you joy - read, write, travel, or explore hobbies. To embrace solitude, try journaling your thoughts. Writing helps process emotions and provides clarity to your mind. If you’re feeling adventurous, plan a solo trip or hike, there’s a unique joy in exploring a new place on your own terms.
 ** _Don’t Rush into Relationships_** : Focus on building a strong relationship with yourself first. The rest will follow. Another important lesson I learned is that seeking a relationship just to escape loneliness doesn’t work. I made that mistake, and it only ended up hurting me more. Relationships thrive on mutual growth and connection, not as a quick fix for loneliness.
 ** _Bring Color to Your Life_** : Cheer yourself up with small acts of kindness, explore new experiences, and don’t shy away from taking risks in life. If loneliness creeps in, even in a crowd, consider joining a club or class that aligns with your interests. Surrounding yourself with like-minded people can naturally lead to meaningful connections. Volunteering for a cause you care about is another great way to meet new people while giving back.

#### The Last Note
A friend of mine once joked that whenever I feel low or lonely, I should hurt my best buddies instead of hurting myself. Surprisingly, it was one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever received. Spending time with friends - trolling, roasting, sharing laughs, and letting loose, proved to be the perfect antidote to loneliness.
  

The journey between being alone and feeling lonely is a deeply personal path that everyone navigates. I’ve learned to embrace solitude as my friend while building meaningful connections to keep loneliness at bay.
  

Remember, loneliness is temporary, and the best antidote lies in building a life so colorful and fulfilling that it leaves no room for it to linger.
 **Being Alone** \- life can still be interesting.
 **Feeling Lonely** \- life can definitely suck.
