Hey 2024,
I know your time is up, and I feel a tinge of sadness bidding you a goodbye. You’ve been a fantastic companion, full of surprises, lessons, and challenges. Let’s rewind and reflect on our journey together - me, you, and the long days and nights.
As the saying goes, " _The greatest battles are with the closest ones_ ," mine too was with one of the most influential people in my life - the most supportive, the most caring person I have ever known. A best buddy of mine, a great mentor too, and many more. By now, I guess you're wondering who that might be, as you have seen many people throughout the year with me. Let me tell you - it is none other than Me, I fought many battles against and with myself, and your helped me grow stronger through it all.
Let’s recap the most important aspects of life you touched and how you shaped me.
####   

#### Work and Career
If you (2024) were a **_Race_** , mine was a marathon with a lot of hurdles, but you made sure there was always a finish line in sight.
I did improve a lot in terms of my technical knowledge, strived hard, and worked relentlessly at my job. I also decided to make the greatest decision of my life, worked on it for more than six months. I know it will bear fruit in the coming years.
But most importantly you taught me that "Life is a never-ending race, and I should take breaks whenever required." You also taught me that taking pauses is as important as moving forward, and I need to conserve my energy until I reach the finish line of one aspect before regrouping myself to start a new race.

#### Stress and Mental health 
If you were a **_Battlefield_** , my fight was with the most dangerous opponent i.e. my thoughts (brain), for peace of mind.
I discovered new things about myself through medical checkups. I learned how chemical combinations in the brain work and how one can improve their overall mood and behavior. I wish I had know them a long back but nonetheless I started working on myself and I look forward to reaping the benefits as early as possible.
If I summarize my entire year I was:
  * Calm and serene for most parts of the day (about 80%).
  * Super angry for about 4-5 days in the entire year. And yes I agree this phase was not fruitful. I did make some harsh decisions that I regretted later. I wish I had handled the situations better.
  * Occasional overthinking that led to stress and more stress as I wondered why I was overthinking. I need to break this deadlock at any cost. 


I wish to improve in ways unimaginable, even in my wildest dreams. And yes, I promise not to become a saint.
* * *
#### Relationships and Connections 
If you were a **_Bridge_** , mine had a few cracks but stood strong at the end nonetheless.
You started with a heavy tone on one of the most important relationships I had. You taught me that not all relationships thrive and that sometimes letting go is better than holding on until I lose balance and fumble. Thank you for that.
You threw a lot of new faces my way throughout the year, and I am slowly building rapport with each one of them. Some useful, some not - but most importantly, you helped me improve my socializing skills and I am grateful for that.
* * *
#### Physical Health
If you were a **_Recipe_** , mine had better ingredients for balance.
Compared to who I was a couple of years ago, I am totally happy with who I am today. I might have gained a few pounds, but I have cut down significantly on processed food, sugar, and many more harmful things.
Time to time, you teased me with all the tasty products available in the market. I realized you liked testing me to see if I would fail. I hope I passed with flying colors.
However, there are still a few things I need to work on, starting with consistency in working out. I only wish I had the guts to challenge you every single day. I am a work in progress, and I aim to improve.
* * *
#### Personal Growth and Self-Reflection
If you were a **_Test_** , mine was all about endurance and self-care.
Anger management, controlling emotions, coming out of Existential Crisis, being the extrovert that I once was, correcting myself when I know I’m wrong, uplifting others by acting as a Human Elevator, realizing that change starts from within, letting go of people when their time is up, and so much more...
These lessons are the biggest proof of who I am, how I am, what I am, and where I am headed. Thank you for everything.
* * *
#### Fun and Adventures
If you were a **_Roller Coaster_** , mine had more loops than straight tracks.
I enjoyed most of your days, to be frank. I don’t want to jinx it by sharing too much. Just know that you were the best.
* * *
#### Creativity and Hobbies
If you were a **_Blank Page_** , I did try to fill you with new things, though a bit late but made it in the end.
I tried many things for the first time this year: volunteering, journaling, and more. Some stuck with me, while others didn’t. I realized that trying new things is the only way to know what I truly enjoy.
You know I was supposed to start blogging way back in February, but I delayed it until October. I’m kicking myself for procrastinating so much. I find it hard to keep up with it, but I don’t want this to fade like other hobbies. I’m up for the challenge and love the instant dopamine high I get from it.
* * *
#### Dreams/Goals
If you were a **_Ladder_** , mine was a steady climb with strong steps but many fumbles along the way.
I failed in a few plans I had at the start of the year. I was broken and shaken. But the best thing about you is that you, as TIME, never stopped for me. You kept going, and I was the one stuck in a few places for a while.
The biggest lesson you taught me was that Time flies and I need to move ahead no matter what happens - fail fast, learn, and move forward was the best from you.
Motto you have given: _Don't stop until you get enough._
* * *
#### Gratitude for Life 
If you were a **_Mirror_** , mine reflected both flaws and strengths.
You showed me who I truly am - someone still growing but learning to appreciate life’s journey.
I now aspire to live each day with intention, celebrating small joys, showing empathy, and practicing kindness toward myself and others.
Thank you for keeping me alive and giving me every one of your 31,536,000 seconds.
* * *
#### Overall 2024
If you were a **_Movie_** , mine was a Drama genre filled with emotional turmoil, unexpected twists and turns, loads of humor, a few anticipated scenarios, failed moments, etc.
You were a combination of blockbuster months, flop months, and a decent half-year.
* * *
So farewell, 2024. I know I will never see you again, but as we part, I thank you for everything, especially for giving me the chance to start anew with 2025.
To everyone who has reached here, I thank you for lending me your precious time. Do yourself a favor and recap your whole year. I’m sure it has already taught you a lot, and a rewind like this will only help you prepare better for 2025. Only you can stop yourself from betterment. No one else, only you.
If 2024 were a ___, what would yours be?
