A personal website showcasing my blogs, projects, and other explorations. Hosted on Bluehost, with a mix of custom-built sites and WordPress-powered subdomains. This repository contains the source code for the custom-built sections, deployed via GitHub Actions for automated updates.

*Note: The "personalWeb site" project has been deprecated as I have moved on to another tech stack.*
